respiratory system	includes	the lungs
medialstium	is a	part of the thoracic cavity
thoracic cavity	is a	body cavity
body cavity	contains	the organs
respiratory system	is responsible for	breathing
breathing	provides	oxygen to the body
oxygen	is necessary for	cellular respiration
cellular respiration	produces	energy
respiratory system	is involved in	gas exchange
gas exchange	occurs in	the alveoli
alveoli	are small air sacs
alveoli	allow	oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse
mediastinum	contains	the heart
heart	pumps	blood
blood	carries	oxygen and nutrients
mediastinum	is also home to	other vital organs
vital organs	include	the thymus and lymph nodes
respiratory system	can be affected by	diseases and disorders
diseases and disorders	may cause	difficulty breathing
difficulty breathing	can lead to	respiratory distress
respiratory distress	can result in	respiratory failure
respiratory failure	can be life-threatening
respiratory system	is susceptible to	infections
infections	can cause	symptoms such as coughing and fever
coughing	is a	reflex action
fever	is a	sign of inflammation
respiratory system	can be evaluated through	various diagnostic procedures
diagnostic procedures	include	imaging tests and pulmonary function tests
imaging tests	can visualize	the structures of the respiratory system
pulmonary function tests	measure	lung function
lung function	can indicate	the presence of respiratory conditions
respiratory conditions	may require	medical interventions
medical interventions	can range from	medication to surgery
surgery	can be performed	in the respiratory system
respiratory system	can benefit from	rehabilitation and respiratory therapy
rehabilitation	aims to	improve lung capacity and function
respiratory therapy	involves	breathing exercises
breathing exercises	can strengthen	respiratory muscles
respiratory system	is connected to	other body systems
other body systems	include	the cardiovascular system and immune system
cardiovascular system	transports	oxygenated blood
immune system	defends	against respiratory infections
respiratory system	can be affected by	environmental factors
environmental factors	include	air pollution and tobacco smoke
air pollution	can irritate	the respiratory system
tobacco smoke	contains	harmful chemicals
respiratory system	is influenced by	lifestyle choices
lifestyle choices	such as	smoking and exercise
smoking	increases the risk of	respiratory diseases
exercise	can improve	lung capacity
respiratory system	is important for	overall health
overall health	is affected by	the respiratory system
respiratory system	plays a role in	maintaining homeostasis
homeostasis	refers to	the body's balanced state
respiratory system	is essential for	survival
survival	relies on	the respiratory system
