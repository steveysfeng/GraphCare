vessel surgery	is a	procedure
vascular access	is a type of	vessel surgery
vascular access	used for	hemodialysis
arteriovenous graft	is a type of	vascular access
arteriovenous graft	used for	vascular access in patients with chronic kidney disease
arteriovenous graft	requires	surgical placement
graft infection	is a complication of	arteriovenous graft
graft infection	can cause	sepsis
sepsis	has a high risk of	mortality
arteriovenous fistula	is a type of	vascular access
arteriovenous fistula	used for	hemodialysis
arteriovenous fistula	has a lower risk of	infection compared to arteriovenous graft
arteriovenous fistula	requires	surgical creation
narrowing of the blood vessels	is a common complication of	arteriovenous fistula
narrowing of the blood vessels	can lead to	decreased blood flow
decreased blood flow	may require	angioplasty
angioplasty	is a procedure to	widen the narrowed blood vessels
angioplasty	can be performed with	balloon catheter
balloon catheter	is inserted into	the narrowed blood vessels
balloon catheter	inflated to	widen the blood vessels
angioplasty	may be followed by	stent placement
stent placement	is done to	maintain the widened blood vessels
stent placement	can prevent	restenosis
restenosis	is the re-narrowing of	blood vessels after angioplasty
restenosis	may require	repeat angioplasty or stent placement
blood clot	is a potential complication of	angioplasty or stent placement
blood clot	can cause	blockage of blood flow
blockage of blood flow	leads to	ischemia
ischemia	can result in	tissue damage
tissue damage	may require	surgical intervention
bleeding	is a potential complication of	vessel surgery
bleeding	can be managed with	hemostasis techniques
hemostasis techniques	include	sutures and cauterization
wound infection	is a potential complication of	vessel surgery
wound infection	requires	antibiotic treatment
aneurysm	is a condition characterized by	weakened blood vessel wall
aneurysm	can be treated with	endovascular repair
endovascular repair	involves	placement of a stent graft
endovascular repair	can prevent	rupture of the aneurysm
rupture of the aneurysm	leads to	life-threatening bleeding
life-threatening bleeding	requires	emergency intervention
endarterectomy	is a surgical procedure to	remove plaque from blood vessels
endarterectomy	commonly performed for	carotid artery disease
endarterectomy	can reduce	risk of stroke
carotid stenting	is an alternative to	endarterectomy for carotid artery disease
carotid stenting	involves	placement of a stent in the carotid artery
carotid stenting	carries	risk of embolization
embolization	is the movement of	plaque or blood clot
embolization	can cause	blockage of blood flow in the brain
blockage of blood flow in the brain	can lead to	stroke
stroke	requires	immediate medical attention
stroke	can cause	neurological deficits
neurological deficits	may require	rehabilitation therapy
venous thromboembolism	is a potential complication of	vessel surgery
venous thromboembolism	can lead to	pulmonary embolism
pulmonary embolism	is a blockage of	blood flow to the lungs
pulmonary embolism	can be fatal
peripheral vascular disease	is a condition characterized by	narrowed arteries in the limbs
peripheral vascular disease	can cause	pain and decreased mobility
pain and decreased mobility	may require	pharmacological or surgical interventions
thrombectomy	is a surgical procedure to	remove a blood clot
thrombectomy	used for	acute arterial occlusion
thrombectomy	can restore	blood flow to the affected limb
