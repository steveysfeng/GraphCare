cystic fibrosis	is a	genetic disorder
cystic fibrosis	affects	the lungs
cystic fibrosis	affects	the digestive system
cystic fibrosis	is caused by	mutations in the CFTR gene
CFTR gene	produces	CFTR protein
CFTR protein	regulates	the movement of salt and fluids in and out of cells
cystic fibrosis	results in	thick	sticky mucus production
thick	sticky mucus	obstructs	airways
thick	sticky mucus	obstructs	the pancreatic ducts
cystic fibrosis	leads to	lung infections
cystic fibrosis	leads to	digestive problems
cystic fibrosis	increases the risk of	malnutrition
cystic fibrosis	increases the risk of	diabetes
cystic fibrosis	increases the risk of	liver disease
cystic fibrosis	increases the risk of	osteoporosis
cystic fibrosis	increases the risk of	infertility
cystic fibrosis	requires	lifelong treatment
treatments for cystic fibrosis	include	airway clearance techniques
treatments for cystic fibrosis	include	medications to thin mucus
treatments for cystic fibrosis	include	pancreatic enzyme supplements
treatments for cystic fibrosis	include	antibiotics to treat lung infections
treatments for cystic fibrosis	include	insulin for diabetes management
treatments for cystic fibrosis	include	vitamin D and calcium supplements for osteoporosis prevention
cystic fibrosis	may require	lung transplant
cystic fibrosis	may require	liver transplant
cystic fibrosis	may require	pancreas transplant
cystic fibrosis	can be managed	with personalized treatment plans
cystic fibrosis	is a chronic	life-limiting condition
cystic fibrosis	has a variable	disease progression
cystic fibrosis	has a	shortened lifespan
early diagnosis	improves	outcomes for cystic fibrosis patients
genetic testing	can confirm	cystic fibrosis diagnosis
cystic fibrosis carriers	have a	50% chance of passing on the gene mutation
cystic fibrosis	may present with	respiratory symptoms in infancy
cystic fibrosis	may present with	failure to thrive in infancy
cystic fibrosis	may present with	recurrent lung infections
cystic fibrosis	may present with	malabsorption and poor weight gain
cystic fibrosis	may present with	salty-tasting skin
cystic fibrosis	is a	progressive disease
cystic fibrosis	requires	regular monitoring
cystic fibrosis	may lead to	respiratory failure
cystic fibrosis	may lead to	end-stage lung disease
cystic fibrosis	may lead to	liver cirrhosis
cystic fibrosis	may lead to	pancreatic insufficiency
cystic fibrosis	may lead to	infertility in males
cystic fibrosis	increases the risk of	respiratory exacerbations
cystic fibrosis	increases the risk of	lung function decline
cystic fibrosis	increases the risk of	hospital admissions
cystic fibrosis	increases the risk of	lung transplant complications
cystic fibrosis	increases the risk of	liver transplant complications

lung transplantation	improves	survival in cystic fibrosis patients
lung transplantation	is associated with	complications and risks
lung transplantation	requires	lifelong immunosuppression
lung transplantation	may develop	chronic rejection
pancreatic insufficiency	requires	enzyme replacement therapy
enzyme replacement therapy	improves	digestion and nutrient absorption
exocrine pancreatic insufficiency	may require	higher doses of pancreatic enzyme supplements
cystic fibrosis	is one of	the most common inherited life-threatening disorders
cystic fibrosis	has a	wide spectrum of clinical manifestations
