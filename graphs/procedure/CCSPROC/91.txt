peritoneal dialysis	is a	medical procedure
peritoneal dialysis	used for	renal replacement therapy
peritoneal dialysis	involves	cleansing of blood
peritoneal dialysis	requires	catheter insertion
peritoneal dialysis	can lead to	peritonitis
peritonitis	is a complication of	peritoneal dialysis
peritoneal dialysis	requires	dialysis fluid
dialysis fluid	contains	glucose
peritoneal dialysis	can cause	fluid overload
peritoneal dialysis	may induce	ultrafiltration failure
ultrafiltration failure	results in	edema
peritoneal dialysis	requires	frequent monitoring
frequent monitoring	helps in	early detection
peritoneal dialysis	can lead to	hernia
hernia	is a complication of	peritoneal dialysis
peritoneal dialysis	can cause	catheter-related complications
catheter-related complications	include	infection
peritoneal dialysis	needs	regular exchanges
regular exchanges	involve	draining and filling
peritoneal dialysis	requires	strict aseptic technique
peritoneal dialysis	has	different modalities
continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis	is a type of	peritoneal dialysis
continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis	does not require	machine
automated peritoneal dialysis	is a type of	peritoneal dialysis
automated peritoneal dialysis	involves	machine for exchanges
automated peritoneal dialysis	allows	night-time dialysis
peritoneal dialysis	has	advantages over hemodialysis
hemodialysis	is another type of	renal replacement therapy
hemodialysis	is based on	diffusion and osmosis
hemodialysis	requires	vascular access
vascular access	can be	arteriovenous fistula
arteriovenous fistula	requires	surgical creation
hemodialysis	can cause	hypotension
peritoneal dialysis	is suitable for	certain patient populations
certain patient populations	include	children
certain patient populations	include	elderly
peritoneal dialysis	can be	done at home
peritoneal dialysis	allows	greater flexibility
peritoneal dialysis	is associated with	improved quality of life
peritoneal dialysis	has	long-term complications
long-term complications	include	abdominal wall hernia
long-term complications	include	encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis
peritoneal dialysis	requires	regular follow-up
regular follow-up	helps in	early detection of complications
peritoneal dialysis	can lead to	protein loss
protein loss	may require	dietary modifications
peritoneal dialysis	can lead to	catheter malfunction
catheter malfunction	necessitates	surgical intervention
peritoneal dialysis	can lead to	dialysate leaks
dialysate leaks	can cause	peritonitis
peritoneal dialysis	requires	education and training
education and training	helps in	patient self-management
peritoneal dialysis	requires	comprehensive assessment
comprehensive assessment	includes	nutritional evaluation
comprehensive assessment	includes	adequacy of dialysis
adequacy of dialysis	can be evaluated using	peritoneal equilibration test
peritoneal equilibration test	assesses	small solute transport
peritoneal dialysis	may require	adjustments in medication
medication	should be	carefully monitored
peritoneal dialysis	can cause	electrolyte imbalances
electrolyte imbalances	require	correction
peritoneal dialysis	allows	preservation of residual renal function
residual renal function	is beneficial for	overall health
peritoneal dialysis	is a	cost-effective option
peritoneal dialysis	has	contraindications
contraindications	include	prior abdominal surgeries
peritoneal dialysis	requires	compliance
compliance	is crucial for	treatment success
peritoneal dialysis	requires	regular access care
access care	involves	catheter site care
peritoneal dialysis	can be	interrupted by infection
infection	can lead to	peritonitis
peritonitis	requires	antibiotic treatment
peritoneal dialysis	requires	strict fluid management
strict fluid management	helps in	preventing complications
peritoneal dialysis	can lead to	technique failure
technique failure	may require	switch to alternative therapy
peritoneal dialysis	has	limitations
limitations	include	peritoneal membrane failure
peritoneal membrane failure	results in	inadequate ultrafiltration
peritoneal dialysis	can lead to	loss of residual renal function
loss of residual renal function	may necessitate	switch to hemodialysis
