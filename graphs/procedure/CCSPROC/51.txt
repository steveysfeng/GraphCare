endarterectomy	is a	surgical procedure
endarterectomy	used for	removing plaque from arteries
endarterectomy	commonly performed on	carotid arteries
carotid arteries	supply blood to	brain
carotid artery stenosis	can lead to	stroke
carotid artery stenosis	is diagnosed using	doppler ultrasound
doppler ultrasound	measures	blood flow
carotid endarterectomy	is a type of	endarterectomy
carotid endarterectomy	can reduce	risk of stroke
carotid endarterectomy	performed under	general anesthesia
general anesthesia	induces	unconsciousness
stroke	characterized by	sudden loss of brain function
stroke	can result in	paralysis
paralysis	is the loss of	muscle function
paralysis	can affect	one side of the body
carotid endarterectomy	is associated with	mortality risk
carotid endarterectomy	may require	hospitalization
hospitalization	involves	staying in the hospital
hospitalization	can increase	risk of infection
infection	may require	antibiotic treatment
antibiotic treatment	is administered to	kill bacteria
carotid artery stenting	is an alternative to	carotid endarterectomy
carotid artery stenting	involves	inserting a stent
stent	is a	metal mesh tube
stent	expands to	keep the artery open
carotid artery stenting	carries a	risk of complications
complications	can include	bleeding
complications	may lead to	rehospitalization
rehospitalization	increases	healthcare costs
rehospitalization	can be prevented with	proper postoperative care
endarterectomy	has a	recovery period
recovery period	varies depending on	individual
endarterectomy	requires	follow-up appointments
follow-up appointments	monitor	healing progress
endarterectomy	is performed by	vascular surgeons
vascular surgeons	specialize in	blood vessel diseases
endarterectomy	is covered by	insurance
insurance	helps with	medical costs
endarterectomy	has a	success rate
success rate	is measured by	improved blood flow
endarterectomy	can improve	quality of life
quality of life	refers to	overall well-being
endarterectomy	should be considered	when conservative treatments fail
conservative treatments	include	medication therapy
endarterectomy	has	risks and benefits
benefits	may outweigh	risks
endarterectomy	may be recommended	for high-risk patients
high-risk patients	have severe	carotid artery stenosis
endarterectomy	may be performed	in an outpatient setting
outpatient setting	allows patients to	go home the same day
endarterectomy	requires	preoperative evaluation
preoperative evaluation	assesses	patient's overall health
endarterectomy	should be performed	by experienced surgeons
experienced surgeons	have expertise in	the procedure
endarterectomy	can be performed with	minimally invasive techniques
minimally invasive techniques	result in	smaller incisions
endarterectomy	may be contraindicated	in certain patients
contraindicated patients	include those who	are not fit for surgery
