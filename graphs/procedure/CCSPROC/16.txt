repair of retinal tear	is a	surgical procedure
repair of retinal tear	used for	treatment
retinal tear	can cause	retinal detachment
retinal detachment	is a	medical condition
retinal detachment	can cause	vision loss
retinal detachment	requires	urgent treatment
surgical repair	is done by	ophthalmologist
ophthalmologist	performs	retinal surgery
retinal tear	may result from	trauma
trauma	can lead to	retinal tear
retinal tear	can be diagnosed by	ophthalmologist
ophthalmologist	can use	retinal imaging
retinal imaging	helps in	diagnosis
retinal imaging	involves	capturing images of the retina
retina	is the	innermost layer of the eye
retinal tear	commonly occurs in	older adults
retinal detachment	can be caused by	age-related changes
retinal detachment	can be treated with	laser surgery
laser surgery	helps in	sealing the retina
retinal detachment	can be treated with	pneumatic retinopexy
pneumatic retinopexy	involves	injecting a gas bubble into the eye
gas bubble	helps in	pushing the retina against the wall of the eye
repair of retinal tear	can be done using	cryotherapy
cryotherapy	involves	freezing the area around the tear
repair of retinal tear	may require	local anesthesia
local anesthesia	numbs	the eye area
repair of retinal tear	typically has a	high success rate
repair of retinal tear	can reduce the risk of	retinal detachment recurrence
retinal detachment	can be prevented by	regular eye exams
regular eye exams	are recommended for	individuals with high risk of retinal detachment
retinal detachment	is associated with	myopia
myopia	is a	refractive error
refractive error	can increase the risk of	retinal tear
retinal detachment	can be associated with	diabetes
diabetes	can affect	the blood vessels in the eye
retinal detachment	can be associated with	cataract surgery
cataract surgery	may increase the risk of	retinal detachment
retinal detachment	can be associated with	trauma to the eye
trauma to the eye	can result from	accidents
retinal detachment	can be associated with	inflammatory eye conditions
inflammatory eye conditions	can cause	damage to the retina
retinal detachment	can be associated with	genetic factors
genetic factors	can increase the risk of	retinal detachment
retinal detachment	can be associated with	retinal degeneration
retinal degeneration	can weaken	the retina
retinal detachment	can be associated with	previous eye surgeries
previous eye surgeries	can increase the risk of	retinal detachment
retinal detachment	can be associated with	aging
aging	can lead to	changes in the vitreous gel
