local excision	is a	surgical procedure
local excision	used for	removing lesions
large intestine	can have	lesions
lesions	can be	cancerous
local excision	can be	performed without endoscope
local excision	minimizes	tissue removal
tissue removal	can cause	complications
complications	can include	bleeding
local excision	can be	curative
curative treatment	aims to	remove all cancer cells
large intestine	is part of	the digestive system
digestive system	is responsible for	nutrient absorption
local excision	can be	considered as an alternative to colectomy
colectomy	is a	surgical procedure
colectomy	used for	removing a part or the entire large intestine
colectomy	may be necessary if	local excision is not feasible
local excision	may require	anesthesia
anesthesia	helps	manage pain during the procedure
local excision	can be	performed laparoscopically
laparoscopic surgery	involves	small incisions
small incisions	minimize	scarring
local excision	may require	post-operative monitoring
post-operative monitoring	ensures	proper recovery
local excision	may have	long-term outcomes
long-term outcomes	can include	recurrence
recurrence	may require	further treatment
further treatment	can be	chemotherapy
local excision	can be	a minimally invasive option
minimally invasive option	can result in	faster recovery
faster recovery	can lead to	shorter hospital stays
local excision	may not be	suitable for all patients
local excision	requires	skilled surgeons
skilled surgeons	are necessary for	optimal outcomes
large intestine	can be	affected by inflammatory bowel disease
inflammatory bowel disease	can cause	lesions
lesions	can be	precancerous
local excision	may require	a colostomy
colostomy	involves	diverting the bowel to an opening in the abdomen
diverting the bowel	can lead to	changes in bowel function
local excision	may have	cosmetic benefits
cosmetic benefits	can be	important for some patients
local excision	may be	less invasive than open surgery
open surgery	involves	a larger incision
local excision	can be	performed under general anesthesia
general anesthesia	induces	a temporary loss of consciousness
local excision	may require	post-operative wound care
post-operative wound care	helps	prevent infection
local excision	may be	a treatment option for early-stage cancer
local excision	is not appropriate for	advanced cancer
local excision	can be	done through the rectum
rectum	is the	final part of the large intestine
local excision	has	risks and benefits
risks	should be	carefully weighed against benefits
local excision	can be	performed in an outpatient setting
outpatient setting	allows	patients to go home the same day
local excision	can have	long-term follow-up requirements
long-term follow-up	helps	monitor for recurrence
local excision	can be	a minimally invasive alternative to open surgery
minimally invasive alternative	may involve	using specialized instruments
local excision	can be	performed using a laparoscope
laparoscope	is a	thin tube with a camera
local excision	can be	a treatment option for early-stage lesions
local excision	may involve	removing a margin of healthy tissue
local excision	may be	followed by radiation therapy
radiation therapy	targets	any remaining cancer cells
local excision	can have	a quick recovery time
quick recovery time	is beneficial for	patients' quality of life
local excision	can be	performed under regional anesthesia
regional anesthesia	numbs	a specific area of the body
local excision	can be	performed with robotic assistance
robotic assistance	allows	for enhanced precision
local excision	can be	performed by gastroenterologists
gastroenterologists	specialize in	digestive system procedures
local excision	can be	a suitable option for certain patients
local excision	can potentially avoid	more extensive surgery
local excision	should be	carefully evaluated for each patient
local excision	can be	combined with other treatments
other treatments	can include	chemotherapy or radiation therapy
local excision	can be	used for both benign and malignant lesions
local excision	can have	varying success rates
success rates	depend on	the type and stage of the lesion
local excision	can be	performed in a hospital or clinic
local excision	can be	performed without making an abdominal incision
without making an abdominal incision	reduces	the risk of complications
complications	can lead to	longer recovery times
local excision	can be	performed with minimally invasive techniques
minimally invasive techniques	result in	smaller scars
local excision	can be	a viable treatment option
local excision	requires	informed consent from the patient
informed consent	ensures	patients understand the risks and benefits
local excision	can be	performed by colorectal surgeons
colorectal surgeons	specialize in	diseases of the colon and rectum
local excision	can have	post-operative dietary restrictions
dietary restrictions	are necessary to	promote proper healing
local excision	can be	combined with chemotherapy or radiation therapy
chemotherapy	targets	cancer cells throughout the body
radiation therapy	uses	high-energy beams to kill cancer cells
local excision	can be	a primary treatment for early-stage lesions
local excision	may be	followed by surveillance colonoscopy
surveillance colonoscopy	helps	monitor for recurrence or new lesions
local excision	is	an alternative to	more extensive surgeries
more extensive surgeries	may involve	removing a larger portion of the intestine
local excision	can be	performed in a minimally invasive manner
minimally invasive manner	reduces	post-operative pain
local excision	can have	long-term outcomes
long-term outcomes	can include	bowel function changes
bowel function changes	can affect	quality of life
local excision	can be	performed using different techniques
different techniques	include	endoscopic mucosal resection or transanal excision
local excision	can be	a less invasive option for some patients
local excision	can be	performed with the patient under general anesthesia
general anesthesia	ensures	the patient's comfort during the procedure
local excision	can lead to	complete removal of the lesion
complete removal of the lesion	may reduce	the risk of recurrence
