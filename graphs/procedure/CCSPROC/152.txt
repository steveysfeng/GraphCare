computer-assisted navigation	helps in	precise alignment of the prosthetic components
arthroplasty knee	has potential complications such as	blood clots and nerve damage
knee replacement	can be performed using	cemented or uncemented implants
cemented implants	provide	immediate fixation
uncemented implants	rely on	bone growth for fixation
knee replacement	is more common in	older adults

knee replacement	may require	assistive devices for mobility
knee replacement	should be followed by	regular follow-up appointments
knee replacement	can reduce	dependency on pain medications
knee replacement	requires	informed consent from the patient
knee replacement	can be performed using	different surgical techniques
surgical techniques	include	total condylar replacement and unicompartmental knee replacement
total condylar replacement	replaces	both the femoral and tibial components
unicompartmental knee replacement	replaces	only the damaged part of the knee
knee replacement	has	long-term durability
knee replacement	can have	implant-related complications
knee replacement	may require	modification of lifestyle post-surgery
knee replacement	can result in	improved joint stability
knee replacement	may require	bone grafting in some cases

knee replacement	is	a common orthopedic procedure
knee replacement	can require	blood transfusion
knee replacement	may not be suitable for patients with	poor health or unrealistic expectations
knee replacement	may have	prolonged hospital stay
knee replacement	involves	removal of damaged cartilage and bone
knee replacement	involves	placement of artificial components
knee replacement	may have	postoperative complications
knee replacement	may require	preoperative education and counseling
