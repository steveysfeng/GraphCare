ace inhibitors	can cause	dizziness
ace inhibitors	recommended for	patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction
ace inhibitors	should be used with caution in	patients with aortic stenosis
ace inhibitors	may be less effective in	older patients
older patients	are at increased risk for	adverse effects of ace inhibitors
ace inhibitors	can cause	renal impairment
renal impairment	may occur	in patients with pre-existing renal disease
ace inhibitors	may be associated with	a persistent dry cough
ace inhibitors	may interact with	lithium
lithium	can increase	the risk of toxicity with ace inhibitors
ace inhibitors	can cause	hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction
ace inhibitors	should not be used concurrently with	angiotensin receptor blockers
ace inhibitors	can cause	hypotension in volume-depleted patients
ace inhibitors	may interact with	diuretics
diuretics	can potentiate	the hypotensive effect of ace inhibitors
ace inhibitors	contraindicated in	patients with a history of angioedema
ace inhibitors	may be less effective in	patients with resistant hypertension
ace inhibitors	can cause	hyperkalemia and fetal toxicity
ace inhibitors	may interact with	potassium supplements
potassium supplements	can increase	the risk of hyperkalemia with ace inhibitors
ace inhibitors	can cause	renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia
ace inhibitors	should be used with caution in	elderly patients
elderly patients	are more susceptible to	orthostatic hypotension with ace inhibitors
ace inhibitors	may be associated with	a dry cough
ace inhibitors	recommended as	first-line therapy for hypertension in patients with diabetes
ace inhibitors	can cause	angioedema and acute renal failure
ace inhibitors	may interact with	allopurinol
allopurinol	can increase	the risk of hypersensitivity reactions with ace inhibitors
ace inhibitors	can cause	renal dysfunction and hypotension
ace inhibitors	should be avoided in	patients with a history of angioedema
ace inhibitors	may be less effective in	patients with aortic stenosis
ace inhibitors	can cause	hyperkalemia and renal impairment
ace inhibitors	should be used with caution in	patients with renal impairment
ace inhibitors	may interact with	NSAIDs
NSAIDs	can reduce	the antihypertensive effect of ace inhibitors
ace inhibitors	recommended as	first-line therapy for hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease
ace inhibitors	can cause	a persistent dry cough and hyperkalemia
ace inhibitors	may interact with	diuretics and potassium supplements
ace inhibitors	associated with	fetal toxicity and renal impairment

ace inhibitors	can cause	renal dysfunction and angioedema
ace inhibitors	recommended for	patients with heart failure and post-myocardial infarction
ace inhibitors	should be used with caution in	patients with impaired renal function
ace inhibitors	may be less effective in	black patients
black patients	have a lower response rate to	ace inhibitors
ace inhibitors	can cause	cough and angioedema
ace inhibitors	may interact with	nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and potassium-sparing diuretics
