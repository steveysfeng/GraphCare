different types of alkylating agents	have	varying toxicities
toxicity	can depend on	the specific alkylating agent used
alkylating agents	can be	administered orally or intravenously
alkylating agents	are not	specific to cancer cells
healthy cells	can also be	affected by alkylating agents
specificity	is an important factor in	cancer treatment
alkylating agents	may be	prescribed at different doses
dosing	is based on	various factors such as patient's weight and overall health
alkylating agents	can be	nephrotoxic
kidney damage	can be	a side effect of alkylating agents
alkylating agents	have	potential long-term effects
long-term effects	may include	infertility
fertility preservation	should be	considered for patients receiving alkylating agents
alkylating agents	can be	carcinogenic
careful handling	is necessary to	minimize exposure to alkylating agents
alkylating agents	can be	metabolized by liver enzymes
liver function	should be	monitored during treatment with alkylating agents
alkylating agents	may interact with	other medications
drug interactions	should be	checked before prescribing alkylating agents
alkylating agents	may increase	the risk of infection
infection	can be	a serious complication in cancer patients
supportive care	is important to	manage side effects of alkylating agents
alkylating agents	can be	teratogenic
pregnant women	should avoid	exposure to alkylating agents
alkylating agents	can be	mutagenic
mutagenicity	is a concern when using alkylating agents
alkylating agents	may require	dose adjustments in patients with renal impairment
renal function	should be	considered when prescribing alkylating agents
alkylating agents	can be	used in combination with radiation therapy
combined modality therapy	can enhance	treatment efficacy
alkylating agents	can cause	neurotoxicity
neurological side effects	should be	monitored during treatment with alkylating agents
alkylating agents	may have	different routes of administration
route of administration	can impact	drug absorption and distribution
alkylating agents	can cause	DNA cross-linking
DNA cross-linking	interferes with	DNA replication
alkylating agents	can induce	cell cycle arrest
cell cycle arrest	prevents	cell proliferation
alkylating agents	can be	used in high-dose chemotherapy regimens
high-dose chemotherapy	may require	stem cell transplantation
alkylating agents	can be	used as immunosuppressive agents
immunosuppression	is a desired effect in certain medical conditions
alkylating agents	can be	used for conditioning prior to transplantation
conditioning regimen	helps prepare	patients for transplantation
alkylating agents	can be	derived from natural sources
natural alkylating agents	have	been used in traditional medicine
alkylating agents	can be	synthesized in the laboratory
synthetic alkylating agents	are widely used in clinical practice
alkylating agents	may have	different dosing schedules
dosing schedule	can impact	treatment efficacy
alkylating agents	can be	used for palliative care
palliative care	focuses on	symptom management and improving quality of life
alkylating agents	can be	used in combination with targeted therapies
combination therapy	can enhance	treatment response
alkylating agents	can cause	long-term complications
late effects	should be	monitored after treatment with alkylating agents
alkylating agents	have	different mechanisms of resistance
drug resistance	is a challenge in cancer treatment
alkylating agents	can be	used for different types of cancer
specificity	is important in	selecting appropriate treatment
alkylating agents	can be	used as a single agent or in combination
combination therapy	can overcome	resistance to alkylating agents
alkylating agents	may be	associated with a higher risk of secondary malignancies
monitoring	is important for detecting potential complications
alkylating agents	can be	administered in cycles
treatment cycle	allows for	recovery periods between doses
alkylating agents	can be	eliminated from the body through various routes
