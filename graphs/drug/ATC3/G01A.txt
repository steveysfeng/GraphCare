various classes	include	antivirals
various classes	include	antiseptics
antiinfectives and antiseptics	can be	used alone or in combination
combinations	may enhance	drug effectiveness
combinations	may reduce	development of resistance
antiinfectives and antiseptics	may be	prescribed for different infections
infections	can be	bacterial

contraindications	include	liver disease
antiinfectives and antiseptics	have	varying mechanisms of action
mechanisms of action	depend on	the specific medication
mechanisms of action	can include	inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis
mechanisms of action	can include	inhibition of protein synthesis
mechanisms of action	can include	disruption of microbial DNA replication
mechanisms of action	can include	interference with viral replication
antiinfectives and antiseptics	require	proper dosage and duration of treatment
proper dosage	ensures	therapeutic efficacy
proper duration of treatment	prevents	treatment failure
antiinfectives and antiseptics	may be	subject to resistance
resistance	can develop	due to misuse or overuse of antibiotics

resistance	can be	community-acquired
resistance	can be	healthcare-associated
antiinfectives and antiseptics	should be	used judiciously
judicious use	helps	prevent resistance
judicious use	minimizes	side effects
antiinfectives and antiseptics	play a	crucial role in infection control
infection control	involves	hygiene practices
infection control	involves	sterilization procedures
infection control	can prevent	healthcare-associated infections
infection control	can reduce	transmission of pathogens
antiinfectives and antiseptics	may have	off-label uses
off-label uses	include	treating non-infectious conditions
off-label uses	should be	carefully evaluated
antiinfectives and antiseptics	should be	used with caution in certain populations
